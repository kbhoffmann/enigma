# Self Assessment

### Functionality -
  For functionality I would give myself a 'meets expectations' grade as my Decrypt and Encrypt command line interfaces are functioning.

### Object Oriented Programming-
  For OOP I would give myself a 'meets expectations' for creating single responsibility classes as well as implementing modules to DRY up code.  

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics-
  For this section I would give myself a 'meets expectations' for following proper convention.  I used various enumerables with both hashes and arrays.  I implemented various hashes into my code.  There is 1 method in which I could have made shorter with helper methods, however I had challenges trying to pull it apart once it was made.  I decided to leave it for the sake of time.

### Test Driven Development-
  For this section I would give myself a grade between 'below expectations' and 'meets expectations' as I did have 1 method that probably would be considered to have more than 1 behavior.  There were a few times in which I did write tests after the code and added more tests to the current test after code was written.  I do have 100% for test coverage metrics.  I could have probably added more edge case tests for certain methods.
